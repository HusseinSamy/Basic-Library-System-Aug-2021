# About

This was a graduation project from a C++ course that I have enrolled in on site (ItSharks - Maadi branch).


We were asked to create a console app where: 
* Admins can:
  * Add, Remove, Update Delete books.
* Students can:
  * Borrow books
  * Return books


It was a simple application but I have applied most of the concepts that I have learned throughout the course like: 
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Control Statements
  * Classes 
  * Objects
  * Constructor 
  * Destructor
  * Access Modifiers
  * Encapsulation
* Loops 
* Functions 
* Arrays 
* Vectors
* Structs
* Input & Output streaming 

You can find the course's curriculum [here](https://itsharks.co/c/mobile-app/course/c-plus-plus).

I also want to mention that I was asked to create only one project but I was able to create 2 projects (You can find the other one 
[here](https://github.com/HusseinSamy/Basic-Banking-System-August-2021)) while all 
my fellows were struggling creating their first project and I was honored for being a top-notch student and discussed
how I have built the project in front of all the class.
